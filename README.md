# OSFL
Open Source Financial Literacy

# Mission Statement
Open-Source Financial Literacy is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping ensure the financial wellbeing of all people regardless of profession, skills, or income.

# Repo
Open-Source Financial Literacy consists of a growing number of tools, programs, forums, wikis, and information aimed directly at serving the novice or intermediate investor who is looking to learn the basics of investing for a financially independent future.

# Community
The target audience and/or member of the OSFL community is anyone that has an interest in learning or growing in financial independence and is willing to work with and give back to the community at hand.  There are no requirements or skill sets.

# Future of the Organization
OSFL is planned to be a slow growing community of experts and novices alike that have a central location to collectively develop open-source financial literacy and planning tools, financial theories on financial independence, moderated discussion forums, and other financial independence themed ideas.  The success of the organization, like all open-source projects, will be up to the growth and sustainability of the community.
